# All Pass Filter Suite
Chameleon contains all the allpass filters you will ever need for your creative work.

- **Chameleon 1**: First order allpass filter with frequency control
- **Chameleon 2**: Second order allpass filter with frequency and q controls
- **Chameleon N**: Nth order allpass filter with frequency, q and order controls
- **Chameleon X**: Stacking of up to X allpass filters in creative ways

Chameleon 1 and 2 are your bread and butter allpass-filters.
They can be used to avoid (or cause) phase cancellation and phase alignment but also be crafted to take over your common filter types (low-/high-cut, bandpass, notch).

Chameleon N stacks multiple allpass filters at the same frequency, resulting in an Nth order allpass filter.

Finally Chameleon X distributes multiple allpass filters in creative ways.
It allows to uniquely apply allpass filters to disperse sounds, cause pitch-shifting or do crazy levels of sound design.
