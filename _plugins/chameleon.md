# All Pass Filter Suite
The Chameleon Suite is a comprehensive collection of audio-plugins based on the concept of allpass filters that will unlock and empower you with creative flexibility and precision for your audio projects.

- **Chameleon 1**: First order allpass filter with frequency control
- **Chameleon 2**: Second order allpass filter with frequency and q controls
- **Chameleon N**: Nth order allpass filter with frequency, q and order controls
- **Chameleon X**: Artfully stacking X allpass filters for full creative freedom


Chameleon 1 and Chameleon2 are your bread and butter allpass-filters. 
By mixing, adding and/or subtracting the processed signal from the dry signal they can create low-, notch-, high- and bandpass-filters

Chameleon N stacks multiple 2nd order allpass filters at the same frequency, resulting in a Nth order allpass filter that allows for wild processing as the phase rotation quickly sums up.

Finally, Chameleon X distributes multiple 2nd order allpass filters around a central frequency with additional controls for the placement of the filters to allow for frequency dependant delays, dispersed sounds, pitch-shifting and far more!
